An open request is a request for services that has not yet been accepted by a Namaste Restauranter (“Open Request”). Namaste Restauranters can use the Application to review Open Requests and to indicate their availability for Open Requests. Once a Namaste Restauranter has accepted a Namaste Restaurant Request pursuant to Section 2, the Namaste Restaurant Request will become a “Namaste Restaurant Engagement”.

Do not accept an Open Request unless you are sure that:&nbsp; (1) you understand what you are being asked to deliver; (2) you can perform the Services identified in the Open Request; (3) you can deliver the Services in the requested time period; and if required, you can get to and from the Customer’s location. Failure to timely deliver the Services consistent with the Customer’s requirements and specifications will constitute a breach, resulting in non-payment. Further, in the event of such a breach, you will be responsible for payment of any additional fees (e.g., rush fees) or costs incurred as a result of your failure to timely complete the Open Request in accordance with the Customer requirements.
